## Italian Food - Restaurant App

This app was my engineering thesis in college.
It was written in React. I used styled-components to style the application.

In the application I created functionalities such as:
- Registration/Login
- Admin panel with CRUD operations
- Meal search, sorting, filtering, pagination
The application used the REST API, which I also wrote myself as part of an engineering thesis. (It is available in another repository).
